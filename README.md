ESP32 Devkit Type C
===================

**DISCLAIMER: I've not tested this design yet**

This PCB is a USB Type C enabled EDP32 development board. It is pin-compatible
with the ESP32 Devkit C but sports a slightly decreased width to fit on a
standard breadboard.

Furthermore this board is optimized for JLCPCB assembly, a Chinese SMT PCB
assembly service. All components on this board, except the USB Type C connector,
the push buttons and the pin headers can be assembled by them for around ~$8
including PCB manufacturing and components.
